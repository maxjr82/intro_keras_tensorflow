This is a repository for the online course of introduction to the Keras/Tensorflow API for 
developing deep learning models. The course is offered by the [Imperial College London through 
the Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-tensor-flow2), and 
it was designed to teach the basic steps in a typical end-to-end  workflow of deep learning models, 
illustrating with practical hands-on tutorials how to build, train, evaluate, and make predictions 
with models using the Sequential API. In addition, one can learn in this course how to validate 
models, include regularisation, how to implement callbacks, and save/load models. 

The repository includes notebooks with all the exercises proposed during the course and corresponding 
answers with code implementation. There is also a notebook in a separate folder with the Capstone 
Project developed in the end of the course to implement an image classifier from scratch using a
deep learning model.
